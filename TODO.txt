Get mono stream from pulse monitor source and use that as a pipe input instead.

find a library that'll let me use piped PCM (or whatever raw format) as something to process in realtime

figure out what PCM actually looks like and what you can do with it.
    -One thing you could do is use python "audiolab" to probably convert numpy arrays to wav files if you need them.

Best libraries for doing filtering/analysis:
    -pyo for "signal processing chains"
    -Maybe audiolazy
    -Fricture for GUI stuff
    
    -LibXtract, Yaafe, aubio, LibROSA for feature extraction

        -LibROSA seems really neat,
        -but aubio seems better for realtime stuff maybe?

Project Organization:
    -First setup serial link, write different modules to do different visualizers
        -(maybe toggle visualizers with button push on nunchuck)
